== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my source store work as normal during the migration? =
The migration plugin only copies data from your source store to your WooCommerce store. Nothing will be changed on your source store and it will work as normal during the migration process.

= What information is required to migrate my store to WooCommerce? =
- For self-hosted websites (open-source eCommerce platforms), you need to download [the Kitconnect](https://next-cart.com/faq/what-is-kitconnect-package/) from the first migration step and upload it to your website root folder. Then you can use your website URL to start the migration.
- For cloud-based websites (cloud eCommerce platforms) that support API access, you need to create API credentials and use them for the migration (you will see a tutorial link on How to get the API credentials below the setup form). Go to this [Migration Guides](https://next-cart.com/category/migration-guides/) to find the specific instruction for your shopping cart.
- For cloud-based websites (cloud eCommerce platforms) that does not support API access, you need to export data from your website to files and use the data files for the migration (you will see a tutorial link on How to get the data files below the setup form).

= Where can I find the detail instruction for using the plugin? =
The detail instruction is integrated into the plugin under **How It Works** menu tab. Please read it carefully before performing the migration. You could find the complete migration guide here: [How Migration Tool Works](https://next-cart.com/how-migration-tool-works/).

= Does this plugin support WPML and Polylang? =
Yes. The plugin is designed to work accurately with WPML and Polylang.
